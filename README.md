## I have developed a Power BI Real-Time Dashboard that provides instant insights by continuously updating data from multiple sources. This dashboard integrates with live databases, APIs, IoT devices, streaming data sources (Azure Stream Analytics, Power Automate, PubNub), and cloud services to ensure up-to-the-minute accuracy.Using DirectQuery for live connections, Push Datasets for streaming data, and Automatic Page Refresh (APR) for real-time updates, this solution delivers dynamic visualizations, KPIs, and alerts without manual intervention.It enhances decision-making, operational efficiency, and proactive monitoring, making it ideal for sales tracking, performance monitoring, and live analytics.
